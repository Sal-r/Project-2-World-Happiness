Our dataset for this project comes from data collected in the Gallup World Poll. The results of the poll ranked over 150 different countries based on their Happiness Score. Happiness Score is derived based on a number of factors, including the country's GDP per capita, the level of generosity exhibited by citizens, the amount of trust citizens have in their government, the average life expectancy of a citizen compared to the global average, and the level of personal freedom experienced by individuals.  
  
As an example of how we formatted our data, here is a snapshot of the top 10 happiest countries in the world as determined by the poll, and some of the factors that went into determininations.

The primary goal for this project was to create a single visualization that could be changed to graph any two of the factors in our dataset against each other. To that end, the most prominent feature on our deployment is this graph.

The dropdown menus will all update the graph. The X and Y axes' dropdowns will update their respective axis accordingly, and the year tab will change which year's worth of data is being displayed. Hovering your mouse over any of the points on the graph will show you which country that point represents.  
  
Changing the Country or Year tab will update the Information Block, pictured below. The Information Block will show you all the values in our dataset for a given country in the given year. This makes it easy to find any data you need for a particular country in any of the csv files provided.

All of this information can be explored and verified in the deployment of our page. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about the data or methodology, or if you have suggestions or requests of improvements to be made in the future! Thank you.
