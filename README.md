Our dataset for this project comes from data collected in the Gallup World Poll. The results of the poll ranked over 150 different countries based on their Happiness Score. Happiness Score is derived based on a number of factors, including the country's GDP per capita, the level of generosity exhibited by citizens, the amount of trust citizens have in their government, the average life expectancy of a citizen compared to the global average, and the level of personal freedom experienced by individuals.  
  
As an example of how we formatted our data, here is a snapshot of the top 10 happiest countries in the world as determined by the poll, and some of the factors that went into determininations.

The primary goal for this project was to create a single visualization that could be changed to graph any two of the factors in our dataset against each other.
